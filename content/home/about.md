<h2>Hello</h2>
I am a Post-doctoral Researcher working with  [Karthik V Raman](https://www.tifrh.res.in/~raman) at [TIFR Hyderabad](https://www.tifrh.res.in/). My present research interest is on proximity induced superconductor. Currently, I am working on MgB2 thin films, high temperature BCS superconductor. 

Previously I did my [Phd thesis](http://www.ino.tifr.res.in/ino/theses/Thesis_Mathimalar.pdf) on NTD Ge sensor development for
superconducting bolometers.  In which, I had developed the Neutron Transmutation Doped Ge (NTD Ge) sensor for the superconducting Tin absorber which will be operating at 10mK. The NTD Ge sensors will be employed to detect the thermal pulse of the rare event decay called Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (NDBD) in 124Sn absorber. The experiment The [INdia's TIN detector (TIN.TIN)](http://www.tifr.res.in/~tin.tin/) will be housed at the upcoming [India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO)](http://www.ino.tifr.res.in/ino/).
